#Graphical User Interface Image Processing

##		Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
[OpenCV
PIL
PyQt5
Matplotlib]

```Read Getting started to see how to download the necessaary libraries```

##		Overview
This repository contains a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed for basic digital image processing operations.
The GUI allows you to apply the following operations:

`Binarization`

Grayscale Conversion

Binarization using Otsu's Method

Binarization using Gaussian Method

Histogram Equalization

Region Growing Method (named "Amibas")]

`Additionally, the GUI provides the functionality to visualize image histograms.`

##		Features
[Binarization:] `Convert images to binary format.

[Grayscale]: `Convert images to grayscale.

[Otsu's Binarization:] `Apply Otsu's method for image binarization.

[Gaussian Binarization:] `Apply Gaussian method for image binarization.

[Histogram Equalization:] `Enhance the contrast of images using histogram equalization.

[Region Growing (Amibas):] `Segment images using the region growing method.

[Histogram Visualization:] `View the histogram of the processed images.

##		Getting Started
```
To run the code, ensure you have the required libraries installed.
You can install them using the following commands:
```
[pip install opencv-python]
[pip install pillow]
[pip install pyqt5]
[pip install matplotlib]

##		Usage
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Run the main script to launch the GUI:
[python GUI-4.0.py]

##		Important Note

The documents include a folder named [libreria](Libreria). 
Please ensure you add this library to your Python libraries 
or, alternatively, have it in the same directory as your code.
